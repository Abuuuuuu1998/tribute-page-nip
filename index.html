Known as the earliest computer programmer in the world, and that too the first woman to have achieved this feat, Ada Lovelace is known for her mathematical works in collaboration with the "Father of the
Computer", Charles Babbage. She was initiated into the profession by
her mother, who feared that poetry would spoil the young woman's
morals, just as it did for Ada's father, Her initial works with Babbage,
earned her fame and recognition, andshe was inspired to venture into
arenas like phrenology, human emotions, and mesmerism. Since he private life was full of confusion and
heartbreak, she made up for her personal shortcomings with her
astounding scientific work. Her mathematical writings were much appreciated by eminent people like of Numbers
“A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy
and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible.”
Lord Byron. Though brilliant in the field of mathematics and science, the
young girl also harboured a love for
poetry, and preferred to blend the
seemingly unrelated subjects, in her
work. She liked calling herself an
"Analyst (& Metaphysician)",
working on what could be termed
"poetical science", often using poetry
to verify her doubts in mathematics.
Michael Faraday. Despite a short life,
Lovelace left her mark in the history
of mathematics and computers. Read
on to explore more about her life and
works here.

	<h2>Ada Lovelace Day</h2>
	<p>
(October 11th 2016) is about sharing
stories of women — whether
engineers, scientists, technologists or
mathematicians — who have inspired
you to become who you are today.
The aim is to create new role models
for girls and women in these maledominated
fields by raising the profile
of other women in STEM.
